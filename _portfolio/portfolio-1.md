Crop cultivation relies heavily on soil conditions and its components. Understanding soil conditions and selecting appropriate crops for specific land is crucial for successful cultivation. To achieve this, we tried to develop a ranking system using TOPSIS (a decision analysis method for multi-criteria problems). This involves measuring soil moisture, temperature, and nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. By incorporating multiple sensors, the required values can be obtained for a specific land. The algorithm then assigns weights to these features, allowing for the ranking of crops based on their nutritional value and soil condition. This approach maximizes crop cultivation scope and maximizes crop quality and quantity.
